# Explain what the APIs

## Explain API types

APIs are widely accepted and used in web applications. There are 4 important types of API that are usually used in mainly web based applications: public, partner, private, and composite. In this context, an API's "type" refers to the scope of its supposed use.

1. **Public APIs :** Public APIs are open and available for use by any third party company or developer. A company that builds a business approach that entails sharing its software and information with different organizations will leverage and provide a public API, and public APIs generally include moderate authentication and authorization. The agency may also look to monetize the API by charging a price per call to the public API.

2. **Partner APIs :** A partner API, available in a simpler form to discerning and certified third-party developers or API consumers, is a way to facilitate inter-enterprise activities. For example, if an organization wants to selectively share their consumer information with third-party CRM organizations, an API partner can connect their internal customer information system to those third parties - a different API is not allowed, and partners have specific rights and licenses to Access to those applications APIs. For this reason, partner APIs usually have stronger authentication, authorization, and security mechanisms. Organisations also usually don't directly monetize these APIs; Partners are paid for their services instead of using an API.

3. **Internal APIs :** An internal (or proprietary) API is designed solely for use within an organization, to communicate systems and data within a company. For example, an internal API may connect an organization's payroll and HR systems, and internal APIs usually offer poor security and authentication - or not at all - because APIs are for internal use, and these security levels are supposed to In place through other policies.  However, this is changing with increased threat awareness and regulatory compliance requirements increasingly affecting an organization's API strategy.

4. **Composite APIs :** Composite APIs generally combine two or more APIs to create a series of related or interrelated operations. Composite APIs can be useful for handling complex or closely related API behaviors, and can sometimes improve speed and performance over individual APIs.

## Explain the benefits of APIs

As needs change, APIs help support unexpected future uses. Providing data via the API can support faster and easier data migration and improve data quality auditing and cleaning. APIs can provide greater flexibility in service delivery; For example, using a service that accesses a backend system to run a new product.

### Advantages of using APIs for developers:

1. Automation: Using APIs, computers instead of people can manage the work. Through APIs, agencies can update workflows to make them faster and more productive.
 
2. Application: Since APIs can access application components, the provision of services and information is more flexible.
 
3. Greater Scope: Using the API, an application layer can be created that can be used to distribute information and services to new audiences that can be customized to create personalized user experiences.
 
4. New data available: The API allows all information generated at the government level to be made available to every citizen, not just a select few.
 
5. Efficiency: When API access is provided, automatically generated content can be published and made available to each channel. It allows it to be shared and distributed more easily.
 
6. Integration: APIs allow content from any website or app to be more easily embedded. This ensures more fluid information delivery and an integrated user experience.
 
7. Personalization: Through APIs, any user or company can customize the content and services that they use the most.
 
8. Adaptation: needs change over time and APIs help anticipate changes. When working with this technology, data migration is better supported, and the information is more closely reviewed. In short, APIs make service delivery more flexible.

**What is an SDK?**

SDK (software development kit) is also called a devkit, which is a fixed set of software creation tools for a given platform, such as build modules, debuggers, and often a framework or set of code libraries that include a fixed set of methods unique to the operating system (OS). 

**What is an API?**

The API is a set of libraries that make up the primary language that you can work with out of the box, while the SDK is a development toolkit that facilitates the uses of the API.  Conceptually, both are a way for your program to interact with and control resources provided by another program. This software can be a web service, an end user application, an operating system service or daemon, or a kernel device driver.

**Difference Between an API and SDK**

The API is a set of libraries that make up the primary language that you can work with out of the box, while the SDK is a development toolkit that facilitates the uses of the API.  Conceptually, both are a way for your program to interact with and control resources provided by another program. This software can be a web service, an end user application, an operating system service or daemon, or a kernel device driver. APIs and SDKs are similar, so it can be difficult to understand exactly the difference between the two, or when you should choose to use one or the other. Another potential source of confusion comes from the fact that SDKs often contain one or more APIs and help implement them. However, an API SDK will not always have a companion, while an API is designed with the intent of performing a specific function to allow communication between applications, the SDK is an integrated platform that houses a set of tools for creating such applications.  APIs facilitate and allow interaction between applications, but they alone are not enough to create a completely new application. In other words, an API might be better for your project if you're looking to add some specific features. If you are starting a completely new project, the SDK will provide the tools you need to get started.

**Comparison of API vs SDK**

| API             | SDK                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose         | Connects and integrates programs                     | Contains a variety of development tools |
| Characteristics | Lightweight, fast, usually specialized               | More robust, usually includes many utilities |
| Use Case        | Used for adding specific functions to an application | Used for creating new applications or adding many functionalities with one package |
